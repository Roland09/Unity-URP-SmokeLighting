This project is a proof of concept of most common workflows for Smoke particles lighting:
* Unity 2021.2
* Universal Render Pipeline (Forward)
* Usage for VFX Graph and Shuriken

It supports the following workflows :

* 6-Way Lightmaps (RLT+BBF)
* ASTA (Ambient, Scattering, Temperature and Alpha) Workflow for explosions
